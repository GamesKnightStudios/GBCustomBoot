# Game Boy Custom Boot
Change the nintendo logo to your own custom message!

## Description
When the Game Boy starts up, it normally displays the nintendo logo dropping down from the top of the screen (on origional GameBoy) or underneath the falshy GameBoy logo (on the GameBoy color). It may surprise you to know that this can actually be modifed. This is because it is loaded from the Game Cartridge.  
This project was inspired by [dodslaser's blog post](https://blog.dodslaser.se/Almost-Booting-the-Gameboy-with-a-Custom-Logo/).
